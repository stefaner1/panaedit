### How to run

The project uses vite. Run `npm run dev` to create a developement server


### notes & ideas & plans?
- replace redux with zustand maybe
- separate the internal state of the editor from panellum scene file, generate state from it for the viewer as needed
- -> have abstract converter that can be implemented for different viewers too
- update vite, tw, remove not used frameworks
